# KDLP Program management outline

This document specifies how work will be organized, tracked, and
completed for all of the projects within the KDLP program.

## Abstract

At a top level this outline document will be reviewed and amended
three times per year, around January, May, and September.
The KDLP team will conduct an overall evaluation of work
driven by the leader of each project.
We will summarize progress on each project and choose the
leader and their corresponding responsibilities for
the next four month period before the next review.
If necessary, our review will include a revision to this document
modifying the projects and their leaders.

We will organize our program work into specific projects to
be tracked with issues/tickets/cards in a dedicated GitHub project board
for that topic. For each project, the leader ratified here is responsible for
interfacing with the outside world to identify opportunities relevant to their
project, and creating new issues in response to them. They are also responsible
for leading the discussion of that topic during the weekly program meeting and
either completing the ticket themselves or summoning someone to delegate it to.

Once items are converted into an issue and the task is assigned the progress
will be tracked via the ticket's flow through the board, and during each program
meeting, it is the project leader's responsibility to touch on each ticket so
that problems preventing forward progress can be identified and resolved as a group.

If you create an issue, you are the implicit assignee.
If you are the assigned on a ticket,
you should expect to be held responsible
for progress on that ticket whether you
do it yourself,
delegate it to someone else,
or convince the group that it's not worth doing.
